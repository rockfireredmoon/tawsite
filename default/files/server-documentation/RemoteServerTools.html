<h3>Refresh Time</h3>
Displays active instances and ZoneDef objects, some related information like player counts and instance owner, and the instance expire time.  Before editing grove ZoneDef files in the <a href="ZoneDef/FolderZoneDef.html">ZoneDef</a> Folder, make sure the associated instance ID isn't in this list.

<div class="spacer"></div>

<h3>Refresh Instance</h3>
Displays a list of active instances, their player and creature totals, kill count and drop multiplier, and a somewhat detailed list of creature entities.  The creature details may be incomplete as the server report is limited to a certain length.

<div class="spacer"></div>

<h3>Reload Checksum</h3>
Reload the HTTP file checksums from <a href="Data/HTTPChecksum.html">Data/HTTPChecksum.txt</a>.  Checksums will need to be reloaded if any CAR files were modified.

<div class="spacer"></div>

Reloads <a href="ServerConfig.html">ServerConfig.txt</a>.  Useful if you need to change any variables while the server is running.
