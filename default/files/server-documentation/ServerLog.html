<h2>Purpose</h2>
This is the main server log file, containing various error, warning, diagnostic, and debugging messages from all the server components.
<p>
<span class="important">Important!</span> This file is erased and begins anew whenever the server is restarted.  If the server crashes, save a backup copy of the log for examination before restarting the server, or the log file's contents will be lost.
<p>
Refer to <a href="ServerConfig.html">ServerConfig.txt</a> for some limited controls on the scope of messages that are logged.
