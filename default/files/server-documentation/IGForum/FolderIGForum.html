<h2>Reference: IGForum (Folder Index)</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
Contains all files used by the In-Game Forum.
<p>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Files</h3>
Category (Subfolder)<br>
Post (Subfolder)<br>
Thread (Subfolder)<br>
IGFSession.txt<br>



<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Category</h3>
This folder holds all category definitions.  Multiple definitions are stored in a single file (a page).  Each page only holds a certain range of IDs.  The page is calculated by dividing the category ID by the number of category IDs per page (64).  Page files begin counting at 00000000.txt.<p>
<h2>File Format</h2>
INI Format.  Each line has a key=value pair.<br>
Comment character: semicolon (;)<br>
Each element has its own [ENTRY] block.<br>
<p>
<h2>Entry Properties</h2>
<table frame=box rules=all>
<tr>
<td>[ENTRY]</td>
<td>Begins a new object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ID</td>
<td>Integer.  Object ID.  Must be unique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Title</td>
<td>String.  Object title.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ParentCategory</td>
<td>Integer.  Category ID of the parent category.  This was originally intended to allow subsections, but wasn't developed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Locked</td>
<td>Bool.  If set to 1, new threads cannot be created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Flags</td>
<td>Unsigned Integer.  This property was implemented after some others, but only one option actually has a purpose.<p>1 : Locked (not implemented, see Locked property instead<br>2 : Stickied (not implemented for categories)<br>4 : Sort threads alphabetically instead of by last update time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LastUpdateTime</td>
<td>Unsigned Long.  Minutes since the operating system epoch when the category was last updated.  Taking the offset between this and the current time determines how long ago it was updated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ThreadList</td>
<td>Integer list, separated by commas.  Each is a Thread ID.  This property may appear on multiple lines.  More IDs will be added to the list.  Autosave output defaults to 10 IDs per line.</td>
</tr>
</table>




<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Thread</h3>
This folder holds all thread definitions.  Multiple definitions are stored in a single file, but if there are too many they will be spread out into additional files.  Files begin counting at 00000000.txt.

<td>CreationAccount</td>
<td>Integer.  Account ID of the player who created the thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CreationTime</td>
<td>String.  Human readable string of the thread creation time, based on the server's local date/time.  This may be blank since through most of the server operation, the value was never set.  It wasn't used in any calculations and wasn't a visible piece of data, so it was ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CreatorName</td>
<td>String.  Character name of the player who created the thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ParentCategory</td>
<td>Integer.  Category ID that the thread belongs to.</td>

<tr>
<td>Locked</td>
<td>Bool.  If set to 1, new posts cannot be created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stickied</td>
<td>Bool.  If set to 1, this thread will always appear at the top of the list of returned results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Flags</td>
<td>Unsigned Integer.  This property was implemented with the intention of getting rid of the separate properties for Locked and Sticked, but never completed since it was working just fine as it was.  So only one of the flags actually works.<p>1 : Locked (not implemented, see Locked property instead<br>2 : Stickied (see Stickied property instead)<br>4 : Sort threads alphabetically instead of by last update time.</td>
