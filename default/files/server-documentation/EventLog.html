<h2>Reference: EventLog.log</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
This is a server log file that contains messages of some player activities, notably picking up loot, dropping (destroying) generated items, trading, and refashioning.
<p>
This file may be helpful on rare occasions if an item is incorrectly refashioned or traded, and a history is needed to determine what happened.
<p>
If the file becomes too large, it may be deleted when the server is not running.
