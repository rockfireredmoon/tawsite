<h2>Reference: FunChatReplace.txt</h2>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
This was a bonus feature implemented for fun and possible trolling, but never actually used during official server operation.  May require testing to make sure it actually works.
<p>
To activate this feature, add the <span class="script">trollchat</span> permission to an  account or character.
<p>
This file contains a listing of words or phrases, and their replacement words or phrases.  If the feature is activated for a player, their incoming region chat messages will be compared to the list.  If a word/phase is found anywhere in the message, that part of the message will be replaced by the replacement word/phrase.  Everyone on the server will then see the modified message.
<p>
Phrase lookups use a lower-case conversion of the incoming message.
