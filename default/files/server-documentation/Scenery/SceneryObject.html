<h2>Reference: Scenery File Format</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
Describes the format of the scenery tile files.  These files are present in the <a href="../Scenery/FolderScenery.html">Scenery</a> and <a href="../Grove/FolderGrove.html">Grove</a> folders, further arranged into subfolders for each specific Zone ID.
<p>
The tile files themselves have a naming convention of x000y000.txt or similar.  Tile coordinates are calculated by dividing a scenery object's X and Z coordinates by the ZoneDef PageSize.
<p>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>File Format</h3>
INI format.  Most lines interpreted as a key=value pair, but are also delimited by commas (,)<br>
Comment character: semicolon (;)<br>
Uses object entry headers.<br>

<h2>Block Format</h2>

<td>Integer</td>
<td>Idle creatures that do not have linked path nodes for patrols will stray randomly around their spawnpoint, up to this distance.  This is box distance.  Distance is expressed in game units, where 10 units = 1 meter.  Defaults to zero (no wandering).</td>
