<h2>Reference: Scenery (Folder Index)</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
Contains the scenery tiles of all official (non grove) zones.  This includes overworld, dungeons, as well as unreleased or testing zones.
<p>
Each zone has its own subfolder.  The folders are named with the Zone ID.
<p>
Each zone subfolder contains a list of text files titled in a x000y000.txt format.  These files contain a list of props.  Refer to <a href="SceneryObject.html">Scenery File Format</a>.
<p>
The X and Y coordinates of a particular tile are derived from the zone's page size.  Typically 1000 game units (most official zones) or 1920 (actual terrain tile size).  Refer to the <a href="../Data/ZoneDef.html">ZoneDef PageSize</a> property to get the actual page size.
