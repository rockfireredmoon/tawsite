  200<br>Erases registration keys from all accounts.  If a registration key exists, a recovery key will be generated before erasure.  This operation was necessary for public release as a way to obscure the registration keys, since they are required for password resets and would be insecure in their original plaintext form. Password resets via the online web form will compare the submitted key against the original key (if it still exists, prior to wipe).  If not, the submitted key will be translated into a recovery key and compared to that.  If it matches the account's recovery key, the original key will be restored to the account.
