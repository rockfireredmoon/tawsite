<h2>Table Columns</h2>

<table frame=box rules=all>
<tr>
<td>DropRateTable</td>
<td>The name of the profile.  There are two built-in profiles which may be customized here (standard, instance).  The defaults are explained below, but they can be modified in the file.  Specific zones or dungeon modes can be assigned new custom entries defined here.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>QL0xxx ... QL6xxx</td>
<td>Drop rate for each corresponding mQualityLevel, from 0 to 6.  Drop rates are expressed as a denominator.  For example, a value of 100 means the drop chance is 1/100, or 1%.  Use a value of 0 to disallow drops.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>QL0xxxL ... QL6xxxL</td>
<td>Minimum creature level required to drop the corresponding mQualityLevel.  Use -1 to disallow drops.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>QL0xxxF ... QL6xxxF</td>
<td>Restrict this corresponding mQualityLevel from dropping only from particular types of creature rarities, or normal or named mobs.  Use a sequence of the following characters.  Any mob types not explicitly written will not qualify, except when using asterisks to automatically include all types.  Lowercase letters mean only named mobs.  Uppercase letters mean both named mobs and regular mobs.
<p>
<div class="mono">
* : All mobs of any rarity, named or not.<br>
N : All normal mobs.<br>
n : Only named normal mobs.<br>
H : All heroics.<br>
h : Only named heroics.<br>
E : All epics.<br>
e : Only named epics.<br>
L : All legendary mobs.<br>
l : Only named legendary mobs.<br>
</div>
<p>
Note that most epic mobs are named.  Legendary mobs generally don't exist, but controls are provided here for completeness.
