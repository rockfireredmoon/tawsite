<h2>Reference: ResCost.txt</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
Determines how much the resurrect options will cost when a player dies.

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>File Format</h2>
Table file.  Tab separated values.<br>
Comment character: semicolon (;)<br>
First line is always ignored (assumed as header).<br>


<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>Table Columns</h2>

<table frame=box rules=all>
<tr>
<td>Level</td>
<td>Must have one line for each possible level, or else the cost won't be retrieved.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Option2</td>
<td>The cost (in copper) of the second option in the resurrect screen.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Option3</td>
<td>The cost of the third option in the resurrect screen.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
When a player dies, the server looks up the player's level in the table, returning the cost amounts for Option2 and Option3.
<p>
Option1 is not included in this file because it must always remain zero.  Otherwise players with zero coin could find themselves in a situation where they are unable to revive.
<p>
Unless otherwise altered, these are the formulas that were used to determine the cost:<br>
Option2 : (Level ^ 3) / 7.5<br>
Option3 : (Level ^ 3) / 2.5<br>
