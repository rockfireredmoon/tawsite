<h2>How it works</h2>
If the player selects a scaling profile (using the <span class="string">/dng</span> client command), any dungeon that is created in their name (solo or as party leader) will be scaled up according to the multipliers of the chosen profile.  Mobs can be scaled up by level, but not down.  However, mobs could be made weaker by setting the level offset to zero, and changing the bonus multipiers to produce lower stats than the original.
<p>
Multipliers should not be negative, and have not been tested.
<p>
Certain stats modified by the scalers will be limited to the maximum acceptable values that the data types support (typically 2 byte integers, maximum value of 32767).  However, if mobs use buff skills that push their values higher, particularly constitution, this may cause problems in the client.  If the resulting health is an overflow, the client will interpret the creature as having negative health and the player will not be able to interact with it.  Keep the scaler amounts within sane limits, and test the results offline.
<p>
Note: The short integer overflow problem can be averted.  See the <span class="mono"> UseIntegerHealth</span> property in <a href="../ServerConfig.html">ServerConfig.txt</a>.
<p>
All creatures in the instance will be scaled with the same profile.
<p>
After examining the trends of most creatures used in the game, it was found that they receive roughly a 7% stat increase (Str/Dex/Con/Psy/Spi, Weapon Damage, Armor Ratings) each level.  The level scalers reflect those trends, but they can be customized to something else.
<p>
The description supports a few basic HTML tags to help format the text when viewed in the client:
<p>
<pre>
&lt;b&gt;...text...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...text...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size="24"&gt;...text...&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color="FFFFFF"&gt;...text...&lt;/font&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Note: Font sizes less than 12, or greater than 32, will crash the client.  Font colors follow hexadecimal RGB notation.
