<h2>Reference: Valid_ATS.txt</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
When a Scenery Object's Asset field is edited, the server attempts to extract the ATS field from the Asset name.  The ATS name is then compared to this list.  If there is a matching ATS entry in the list, the ATS asset is considered valid and will proceed with the edit.
<p>
If the ATS is not valid, the edit will be rejected.
<p>
This system is used because if the client is unable to download a missing ATS file, the client will fail with an error and need to be restarted.  The server rejects the edit to safeguard the asset so that invalid "client-crashing" asset names are not saved and distributed by the server.
