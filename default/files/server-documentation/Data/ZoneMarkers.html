    <td>Float,Float,Float,String,String</td>
    <td>Marks a sanctuary location.  The first three floats are the X,Y,Z coordinates of the sanctuary.<p>The first string is a descriptive name for the location that will appear as your bind location.<p>The last string is optional, and indicates a filter of map regions.  This sanctuary will only be considered as a respawn point if the player is within that region.  Multiple regions may be used by separating them with a pipe "|" character (although current detection only uses a simple substring find).<p>For region names, refer to the <a href="MapDef.html">MapDef.txt Name</a> property.  Note that the actual tile considerations for regions are defined in <a href="MapLocations.html">MapLocations.txt.</a></td>
