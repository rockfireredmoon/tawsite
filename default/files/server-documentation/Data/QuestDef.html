<h2>Other Notes</h2>
Each quest is is divided into any number of acts.  Each of those acts can have up to 3 individual objectives which may be accomplished in any order.  Once all objectives within an act are finished, the quest proceeds to the next act.  Quests are usually finalized with an act containing a single talk objective, the NPC where the quest is redeemed.
<p>
The best way to create new quests is to find a quest that behaves similarly, then copy and paste it as a new entry, updating all the fields as appropriate.  Make sure it has a unique ID.  Copying acts with similar objectives is also helpful.
<p>
For simple talk-only quests, the official quests typically offer half the experience and coin rewards as other quests.
<p>
Some examples of item rewards:
<p>
A bounty board offers a single item that is always given to the player.  NumRewards is left at zero since that field is for choice rewards only, and they cannot opt out of this reward.  The RewardItem's last property (the 'Required' property) is set to 1 to always give that item.
<span class="script">
NumRewards=0
RewardItem.0=21337,1,1
</span>
<p>
In this quest, the player is presented with a choice between two items.  NumRewards is set to 1 because they must choose exactly 1 item from the available 2 rewards.  The 'Required' property is set to zero on both items since they are both optional.
<span class="script">
NumRewards=1
RewardItem.0=5329,1,0
RewardItem.1=5328,1,0
