<h2>Reference: PF Server Command Index</h2>
Documentation of all server slash commands that can be typed into the chat box.
<p>
Some commands have optional or alternate parameters.  Parameters marked in brackets [] are optional.  Parameters marked in braces {} usually accept only those values.
<p>
Many commands require special account permissions to function.  Refer to <a href="Accounts/AccountPermissions.html">Account Permissions</a> for a list of permissions.

<span class="scriptdoc">/pose emoteName [speed] [loop]</span>
<br>
Perform an emote, with optional effects.  The emote name is case sensitive and must match an emote recognized by the client for that model (whether biped or creature).  Speed is a multiplier for the animation's playback rate (for example, 0.5 is half speed, 2 is double speed).  Loop determines whether the animation should be repeated  indefinitely (use 1 to loop).  Note that some animations may play corresponding sound effects, which could be annoying if looped.
<p>
Examples:
<span class="script">
/pose Applaud
/pose Applaud 0.5
/pose Applaud 0.5 1
</span>

<br>
Requires the 'admin' permission.
<p>
Gives yourself an item by referencing it's specific ItemDef ID.  If the item is stackable, a stack count may be provided.
<p>
This is the only command that can be used to give generated items.  <b>WARNING!</b>  If a generated item is destroyed (dropped from inventory, pushed out of buyback, removed by crafting/disassembling), it will be removed from the database.  If another player has this item while a duplicate is destroyed, it will no longer be available.  Use /deleteabove to remove items without destroying them.  Because this command is potentially destructive, the admin permission is required.
<p>
Example:
<span class="script">
/giveid 40053
/giveid 40053 20
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/giveall "Search Name"</span>
<br>
Requires the 'itemgive' permission.
<p>
Gives yourself all items that at least partially match the search term.  Case sensitive.  This may potentially consume remaining inventory space.  The /deleteabove or /deleteall commands may be helpful here.
<p>
This command is sometimes helpful for giving set items, although some items have typos or inconsistent spelling so you may need to search the ItemDef files manually.
<p>
Example:
<span class="script">
/giveall "Planeswalker"
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/giveapp equipID "Appearance"</span>
<br>
Requires the 'itemgive' permission.

<p>
equipID corresponds to <a href="Generic/StatRef.html#mEquipType">ItemDef mEquipType</a>.  Leave zero to allow any item type, or set to a particular value to filter specific equipment types.
<p>
This may potentially consume remaining inventory space.  The /deleteabove or /deleteall commands may be helpful here.
<p>
Examples:
<span class="script">
/giveapp 0 Armor-Cloth-Mid5
/giveapp 15 Armor-Cloth-Mid5
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/deleteall</span>
<br>

<span class="scriptdoc">/deleteabove slotNum</span>
<br>
Remove items from your backpack inventory if their slot index is greater than or equal to the given amount.  Slots begin counting at zero, in the top-left corner of the inventory grid.  This does not "destroy" items, so generated items will still exist in the database.
<p>
Inventory slot index arrangement:<br>
<pre class="mono">
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
  8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15

<p>
The first slot must contain the item with the stats you want to keep.
<p>
The second item contains the new look.  <b>This item will be erased from your inventory if the refashion is successful.</b>  Cost will be deducted automatically.
<p>
Examples:
<span class="script">
/refashion
/refashion 1 
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/backup</span>
<br>
Requires the 'debug' permission.
<p>
Saves a backup of your current character appearance.
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/restore1</span>
<p>
Restores your character appearance from when it was saved using /backup.
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/god {0,1}</span>

Examples:
<span class="script">
/god 0
/god 1
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/setstat statName value</span>
<br>
Requires the 'admin' permission.
<p>
Adjusts a stat on the selected target (or self if none selected).  Note: this does not replace any buffs, so applying or removing buffs may recalculate a stat back into something else.  statName may be any <a href="Generic/StatRef.html#stats">Character Stat</a> (lowercase only).
<p>
This command is helpful for debugging abilities by refilling might/will and charges, giving spare ability points, and changing profession (needs respec).
<p>
It has a practical use for changing clan sub-text, or altering coin and credit amounts, or changing someone's class if they request (will need to respec).
<p>
This is not an effective way to change character names.  It's best to update the character file manually, and change the entry in <a href="Dynamic/UsedNames.html">UsedNames.txt</a>
<p>
Use the /health and /speed commands for an easier way to change those stats for yourself.
<p>
If using a text value that needs spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks.
<p>
Examples:
<span class="script">
/setstat sub_name "Resident Complainer"
/setstat might_charges 5
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/adjustexp amount</span>
<br>
Requires the 'admin' permission.
<p>

<p>
Example:
<span class="script">
/adjustexp 10000
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/scale propID amount</span><br>
<span class="scriptdoc">/scale propID x y z</span>
<p>
Directly edits the scale of a prop.  The first form will set all axis values to a particular amount.  The second form will set individual axis scales.
<p>
<b>Note: props that have been irregularly scaled can have unpredictable visual glitches, especially if they have been rotated. Sometimes they won't glitch right away, only after future edits like position changes. Use custom scaling at your own risk (frustration).</b>
<p>
Bug 1: The most common bug is that props will disappear from your screen, although they still exist both in the client and on the server in their original locations. Use the scenery browser to select them.
<p>
Bug 2: In rare cases, the prop may appear elsewhere in the world. Sometimes they can be directly selected for editing. If not, use the scenery browser to select them. Since the location is being misreported by the client, you may need to increase the search distance beyond what you'd expect.
<p>
Glitched props can be repaired by setting all axis scales to the same value.
<p>
Use the Scenery Browser or Build Tool to determine a prop's ID number.
<p>
Examples:
<span class="script">
/scale 1000000 1.5 2.0 3.2
/scale 1000000 2.5
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>

<p>
Value can be 0 to disable, 1 to enable.

/dtrig 902 filename merge{0,1}<br>
Recommended to use while offline.  Loads scenery from a file.  If merge is set to 1, any incoming props that match a scenery ID of an existing (already loaded and resident in memory) will replace the existing prop.
<p>
This function can theoretically be used to import non-paged scenery into a zone where it will be sorted into the proper scenery tiles.  Before merging, it may be necessary to combine the contents of multiple scenery tiles into one large file, to handle everything at once.

<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/sdiag {0,1}</span>
<br>
Obsolete.  Enables or disables ability self-diagnostics (via the 'selfdiag' account permission).  This was meant to determine if an ability was not firing because of a cooldown problem, and inform the player.  The bug originally responsible for this was fixed long ago.
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/sping [timeMS]</span>
<br>
If used with no parameter, sends a ping report to the client of collected ping counts, the highest and lowest ping time, and collective average.
<p>
Time is a threshold, in milliseconds, to automatically altert the player if it detects a ping time that meets or exceeds the threshold.
<p>
Use a time of 0 (zero) to turn off ping notification.  Use a negative time to reset statistics.
<p>
Examples:
<span class="script">
/sping
/sping 250
/sping 0
/sping -1
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/info category</span>
<br>
Requires the 'admin' permission.
<p>
Returns a small amount of information depending on what is requested.  Use "spawntile" to return the spawn tile coordinates of the standing location.  Use "scenerytile" to return the scenery tile (based on ZoneDef page size).
<p>
Example:
<span class="script">
/info spawntile
/info scenerytile
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/grovesetting action [data] </span>

<p>
/grovesetting filteradd "Character Name"<br>
Adds a character to the filter list.
<p>
/grovesetting filterremove "Character Name"<br>
Remove a character from the filter list.
<p>
/grovesetting filterclear<br>
Remove all players from the filter list.
<p>
/grovesetting filterlist<br>
Returns the list of players currently in the list.

<span class="script">
/grovesetting filtertype 2
/grovesetting filteradd "Annoying Person"
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/grovepermission action [data]</span>
<br>
Sets additional build permissions for a grove, to give other players build access.  Can only be used within a grove.  Your account must match the grove's account owner.  Performs different tasks depending on which action is supplied.
<p>
This command is not user friendly since it requires specific input data which isn't exposed to players.
<p>
/grovepermission add CDefID x1 y1 x2 y2
Adds a build permission for the specified player CreatureDef ID.  IDs can be retrieved from the admin panel.
<p>
/grovepermission delete index<br>
Removes build permissions for a particular entry index (refer to the ZoneDef file to see a list of permissions).  Note that indexes begin at zero.
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/dngscale [profileName]</span>
<br>
Sets the player's chosen dungeon scaling profile to increase creature difficulty.  This function can be called manually, but normally works through the client /dng command where the player can select a profile from the list.
<p>
If the profile name exists, it will be set for that character.  If that character is the party leader or instance owner, the dungeon will be scaled to their chosen profile.
<p>
Refer to <a href="Data/ScaledDifficulties.html">ScaledDifficulties.txt</a> for a list of profiles.
<p>
Example:
<span class="script">
/dngscale Bonus1
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/pathlinks [radius]</span>
<br>
Converts all SpawnPoint links to pathing links (blue lines in the client) instead of loyalty links (pink lines).  Can only be used within a grove.  Your account must match the grove's account owner.  May need a relog to refresh the client view.
<p>
Radius defaults to 300 units (30 meters) if not supplied.  A large radius may not cover the entire zone if the player has not explored that location recently (thus loading the scenery into the server's memory).
<p>
Example:
<span class="script">
/pathlinks 500
</span>
<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/targ</span>
<br>
Requires the 'debug' permission.
<p>

<div class="spacer"></div>


<span class="scriptdoc">/instance</span>
<br>
Returns some information about the current zone/instance.  Total mobs killed, drop rate bonus.  If a dungeon instance, displays the party leader or instance creator.  If a scaled dungeon, it will show the scaler name used.
<p>
If the 'debug' permission is set, shows the drop rate profile.
