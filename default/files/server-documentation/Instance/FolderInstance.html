<h2>Reference: Instance (Folder Index)</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
Contains additional data files specific to each Zone ID which are loaded whenever a new instance is created.  (see <a href="../Data/ZoneDef.html">ZoneDef.txt</a> for information on Zones and IDs.
<p>
There is a folder corresponding to each Zone ID.  Within those folders are files that apply to only that zone.  If a file does not exist, that zone has no data for that particular feature.
<p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p>
The following files, if present in the folder, may be loaded:
<p>
<a href="InstanceScriptCommands.html">Script.txt</a> - Instance script (triggered spawns, teleports, etc).<p>
<a href="EssenceShop.html">EssenceShop.txt</a> - Holds contents of essence chests (any chest that exchanges essences/tokens/keys/etc for items).<p>
<a href="Shop.html">Shop.txt</a> - Holds contents of NPC vendor shops.<p>
<a href="Static.html">Static.txt</a> - Holds a list of static NPC objects that are spawned globally (not by spawn points).<p>
