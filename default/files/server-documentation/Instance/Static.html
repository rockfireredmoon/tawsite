<h2>Reference: Static.txt</h2>

Defines static (stationary) spawns for NPCs, without the need for adding SpawnPoints to a zone.  Static spawns will always be spawned as friendly, neutral, stationary, and invincible.  Ideal for certain quest-givers and reward chests.
<p>
Static spawns are global and are always resident within a zone, even if players are far away.  Every NPC in a region will contribute a negligable amount of server overhead for processing, so it is recommended to avoid excessive use of static spawns.
<p>
Overworld regions include some static NPCs for holiday themed events.  Comment their lines to disable them, or uncomment to enable.
<p>
List file.  One entry per line.  Delimiters: equal sign (=) and comma (,).<br>
