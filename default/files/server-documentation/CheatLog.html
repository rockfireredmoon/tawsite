<h2>Purpose</h2>
This is a server log file that contains warnings of possible suspect activity.
<p>
Botting messages are logged when a player uses too many abilities from a single location.  <b>False positives are extremely common</b>, easily generated by players spamming their abilities or during long fights.  These are merely warning messages, it is up to the server administrator to verify the locations and actions in game, and how frequently they occur.
<p>
Other messages include speed warnings, if the player is moving too fast or is moving
at unexpected speeds.
<p>
If the file becomes too large, it may be deleted when the server is not running.
