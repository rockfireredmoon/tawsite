<h2>Reference: Deleted (Folder Index)</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
All deleted character files are moved out of the <b>Characters</b> folder, and exist here instead.
<p>
This happens when a character is deleted via the character selection screen within the client.
<p>
The files here are not used by the server, they merely exist as a convenient backup if something goes wrong.
<p>
Regular manual backups of all server userdata is still encouraged.
