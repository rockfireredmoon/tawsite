<h2>Reference: Default Character (0.txt)</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
A required character file for default character stats.  This used to have more importance  long ago when the server was first being developed, but a few properties are still important.
<p>
Most notable is the default quickbar setting (in the preferences section) which is required for the autoattack buttons to work properly.  
<p>
If a missing or broken character is attached to an account, this is what you see.
