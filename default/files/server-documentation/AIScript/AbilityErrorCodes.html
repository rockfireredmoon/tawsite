<h2>Reference: Ability Error Codes</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
A listing of ability error codes.  Consult this char if <a href="../Base/ServerConfig.html">ServerConfig.txt</a> DebugLogAIScriptUse is enabled, to determine why an ability may not be activating.
<p>
Codes 0 through 4 are used for internal states and core error handling (like if the ability doesn't exist).
<p>
Codes 5 and beyond are usually a failure to pass the required activation conditions (facing target, in range, enough might, etc).
