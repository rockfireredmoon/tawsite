<h2>Reference: Packages.txt</h2>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
Defines packages, which are lists of sets.  This file is mostly used for assigning armor sets to drop from creatures of a particular level.
<p>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>File Format</h3>
Table file.  Tab separated values.<br>
Comment character: semicolon (;)<br>
First line is always ignored (assumed as header).<br>

<p>

<div class="spacer"></div>

<h2>Table Columns</h2>

<table frame=box rules=all>
<tr>
<td>PackageName</td>
<td>String.  The name for this package.  For lookup purposes, packages and sets should not share any names.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Auto</td>
<td>Integer.  If nonzero, this corresponds to a creature level.  If a creature matching this level is killed, the sets within this package will automatically be included for drop consideration.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Flags</td>
<td>String.  Mostly obsolete.  This was intended to allow extra drop considerations based on the mob's CreatureDef rarity.  <b>This feature was unused, and not tested.</b>  Be sure to test, and don't be surprised if it doesn't work correctly (or not at all).
<p>
Allows a combination of the following characters.
