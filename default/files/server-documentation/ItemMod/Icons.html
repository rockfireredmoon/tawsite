<h2>Reference: Icons.txt</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
Defines a list of all ItemDef mIcon strings that can spawn on items of a particular asset/equiptype/weapontype permutation.

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>File Format</h2>
INI format.  Key=Value pairs.<br>
Comment character: semicolon (;)<br>
Each line is split at the first "=" symbol.

<h3>Properties</h3>
<table frame=box rules=all>
  <tr class="header">
    <td><b>Property</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[ENTRY]</td>
    <td>Begins a new equipment block.  Each block has three essential properties (asset, mEquipType, mWeaponType).  Collectively, no other block should be exactly the same in all three of those properties.
<p>
When an item is rolled, it attempts to find a block that matches all three properties.  Then it rolls randomly for any one of the appearances defined for that block.
</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>asset</td>
    <td>String.  The asset name that will be used to filter what icons may apply to this item.  If an item is chosen with an asset model that looks like a metal plate helmet, it probably shouldn't have an icon of a feather headband.
<p>
When a new item is generated, it selects an appearance (see <a href="Appearances.html">Appearances.txt</a> then determines the asset.
<p>
Those mAppearance strings may contain parts like:
<span class="script">["type"]="Armor-Light-Low1-Helmet"</span>
<p>
Where the resulting asset type is <span class="script">Armor-Light-Low1-Helmet</span>
<p>
Note that multiple types of equipment (helmet, chest, leggings, etc) may reference the same asset model archive.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mEquipType</td>
    <td>Integer.  Corresponds to ItemDef mEquipType.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mWeaponType</td>
    <td>Integer.  Corresponds to ItemDef mWeaponType.  Leave zero if not a weapon.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>app</td>
    <td>String.  Corresponds to ItemDef mIcon.  At least one icon should be assigned to any given asset/equip/weapon permutation.<p>
Normal ItemDef mIcon fields have a foreground and background icon separated by a pipe ( | ), but this field must only be a foreground icon.  The item generation system will automatically append a background icon based on the resulting item's mQualityLevel.  An uncommon (green) item will have green background, etc.</td>
