<h2>Reference: NameMod.txt</h2>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
Defines the prefix and suffix names for items that roll with particular stats.
<p>
See also: <a href="NameWeight.html">NameWeight.txt</a> which defines how stats are weighted for name selection.

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>File Format</h2>
List file.  Delimiters: equal sign (=) and comma (,).<br>
Comment character: semicolon (;)<br>
No header.

<p>
Line Format:
<span class="scriptex">
prefix=stat,text
suffix=stat,text
</span>

<p>
<table frame=box rules=all>
  <tr class="header">
    <td><b>Property</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>prefix</td>
    <td>Entries defined as a prefix will be selected based on the <b>highest</b> weighted stat that rolls on the item.  Since nearly every generated item rolls with at least 1 stat, it will always select a prefix if one is defined.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>suffix</td>
    <td>Entries defined as a suffix will be selected based on the <b>second highest</b> weighted stat that rolls on the item.
<p>
Suffixes will not be examined unless the item spawns with 2 or more affixed properties.  A low level item that only spawns one property cannot have a suffix, because that lone stat is weighted the highest and is therefore a prefix.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>stat</td>
    <td>The character stat to associate the affix name with.  See <a href="../DataSets/Stats.html">Character Stats</a>
<p>
There is a special case if two stats are combined by a pipe character.  Example: <span class="script">strength|dexterity</span>.  If the highest and second highest stats match those two properties (in any order) then they can be given a new prefix (rather than just choosing based on strength or dexterity alone).  This method does not work on suffixes.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>text</td>
    <td>The text that will be added before or after the item name, depending on whether the stat was chosen as a prefix or suffix.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
